<div class="content">
<p>I&#8217;m interested in the study of dreams (ala Feynman) so I think I&#8217;ll write up the ones that I can remember here (ala jwz, SethS, RobM and others).</p>

<p>I was taking the train somewhere with a bunch of <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> programmers and noticed <a href="http://www.zooko.com/">Zooko</a> in the back, coming home from Toronto. (I was very happy he was finally back.) He was wearing a T-Shirt that read Mojoey. I asked why the extra &#8220;ey&#8221; was there and he said it was because it was a living language, like English or Spanish. (This made sense at the time.) I told the Netscape people that I used <a href="http://chimera.mozdev.org/">Chimera</a> and they sounded pleased. I kept looking for <a href="http://people.netscape.com/pinkerton/">Mike Pinkerton</a>, but never found him. I kept wanting to tell Zooko that <a href="http://www.imperialviolet.org/">agl</a> had a lot of email waiting for him but never did. The train stopped and Zooko and I split off at the station, going our separate ways.</p>
